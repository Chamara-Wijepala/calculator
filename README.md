This is my attempt of the calculator project from [The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator)
I hope to put into practice what I've already learned and learn more new things during this project.

UPDATE

After completing this project I practiced the things I've already learned and I learned how to use switch statements and the CSS * selector.
